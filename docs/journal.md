## 2026-08-30 — Pass 1 built, published, and merged. Blocked on Docker Desktop.

### What shipped

**Pass 1 walking skeleton** (PR #1, `43b7f17`) — the whole chain end to end with the
smallest possible surface: bootstrap CLI → token volume → container → stdio → MCP
handshake → one tool → a real authenticated Garmin call.

- One tool, `garmin_auth_status`: read-only, no arguments, so this pass carries none of
  the §5 response-contract decisions (units, timezone basis, result caps).
- 10 tests from a baseline of 0.
- `garmin_mcp/source/` is the only package importing `garminconnect` (SCOPE §11).

**CI + GHCR publishing** (PR #2, `683bea0`) — tests gate the image publish; multi-arch
`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`; pull requests build but cannot push, because the registry
login step is skipped for `pull_request` events.

`main` is at `df7323b`. Image is public at `ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest` —
verified pullable anonymously (anonymous ghcr.io token + manifest fetch returned 200, both
architectures present).

### Two things the library disagreed with the plan about

**A missing token file does not raise `FileNotFoundError`.** `garminconnect.login()`
swallows the load failure in a broad `except Exception`, sets `tokens_loaded = False`, and
then raises `GarminConnectAuthenticationError("Username and password are required")` — the
same exception a genuinely rejected token raises. Without an explicit file-existence check
before `login()`, "never bootstrapped" and "token expired" are indistinguishable and the
operator gets told to re-authenticate when they never authenticated. Fixed, with a test
pinning the distinction.

**`FastMCP` was removed in mcp 2.x.** The entry class is `MCPServer` from `mcp.server`;
the old import path is a shim that raises `ModuleNotFoundError`. This also means every
public Garmin MCP server on GitHub is v1-era and broken against the current SDK, which
independently confirms the decision to build rather than adopt.

Also verified rather than assumed: `get_full_name()` and `get_unit_system()` are cached
attribute reads that make no HTTP call. A smoke test asserting on them alone would be
vacuous — the proof that tokens work is that `login()` completed, since it ends in a real
authenticated profile fetch on every path including cached-token reuse.

### Where we stopped

**Blocked getting Docker Desktop running on the Windows laptop.** Sequence so far:

1. `docker version` printed a `Client:` section with no `Server:` — engine not running.
2. Docker Desktop refused to start: "Virtualization support not detected".
3. Task Manager reported CPU virtualization *Enabled* — that flag is not what Docker means.
   It needs the Windows features.
4. `wsl --status` → WSL not installed.
5. `wsl --install --no-distribution` succeeded, installing WSL 2.7.12 and enabling
   `VirtualMachinePlatform`, twice printing "changes will not be effective until the system
   is rebooted".
6. **Reboot pending.** That is the resume point.

### Resume here after the reboot

> **Superseded by the next entry.** The reboot never happened — bootstrap ran on a
> different laptop that already had a working Docker Desktop. Kept for the record.

```powershell
docker version                      # expect a Server: section, not just Client:
docker pull ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest
docker run -it --rm -v garmin-tokens:/data ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest login
docker run --rm -v garmin-tokens:/data -v "${PWD}:/backup" alpine cp /data/garmin_tokens.json /backup/
```

Choose **WSL2** when Docker Desktop asks for a backend. Leave the `*.docker.internal`
/etc/hosts option unticked — this server never touches the host network.

Back up the token volume immediately after a successful bootstrap. If a captcha ever blocks
a fresh login there is no workaround by design, and that file is the only way back.

Then add to `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` and fully quit/reopen Claude
Desktop (tray icon, not just the window):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "garmin": { "command": "docker",
  "args": ["run","-i","--rm","-v","garmin-tokens:/data",
           "ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest","serve"] } } }
```

Success looks like `garmin_auth_status` returning a real display name and unit system.

### If Docker still fails after the reboot

Then the hypervisor is blocked above the firmware — Credential Guard or corporate policy —
and it is an IT ticket, not a configuration problem. **The fallback is to run natively with
Python, no Docker at all.** Verified against PyPI: `curl_cffi` ships `cp310-abi3-win_amd64`
wheels, `garminconnect` and `mcp` are pure Python, `pydantic-core` has `win_amd64` wheels.
Nothing compiles and nothing needs Linux.

That route needs one contained change first, currently **not done**:

- `DEFAULT_TOKENSTORE` is hardcoded to `/data/garmin_tokens.json`, a container path that is
  meaningless on Windows. It needs a platform-aware fallback (e.g.
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\garmin-mcp\garmin_tokens.json`) while keeping `/data` in the container.
- `BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND` in `source/errors.py` tells the operator to run a `docker run`
  command. On a machine that cannot run Docker that is actively wrong advice.
- Tests for both shapes, so the container path cannot silently break.

### Open items

- `docs/SCOPE.md` cites protocol revision 2026-07-28, but `mcp` 2.1.1 negotiates
  `2025-11-25` in the handshake. Harmless, uncorrected.
- A `garmin-mcp:0.1.0` image built on the staging box to verify the Dockerfile is still
  there (315MB), now redundant since CI builds the image.
- Pass 2 is unstarted: the FR570 capability probe, then the first real data tools. That is
  where the units, timezone and result-cap contracts get designed rather than guessed.

## 2026-08-30 (later) — Bootstrap done on a real account. Stress-test found a live bug.

### The blocker dissolved

The pending Windows reboot never happened. Bootstrap ran on a **different laptop** that
already had a working Docker Desktop (4.44.2, engine 28.3.2, `linux/amd64`, WSL2). The
previous entry's resume steps are superseded.

Pass 1 is now proven end to end against the real account: bootstrap → token volume →
container → stdio → Claude Desktop → `garmin_auth_status` returning a live authenticated
profile. The full chain, on the intended host.

### What the live run settled

Four things §10 carried as unverified now have measured answers:

- **Laptop toolchain** — verified, above.
- **Protocol revision** is `2025-11-25`, not the `2026-07-28` §10 claims.
- **Account unit system is metric.** This settles the §5 units contract with a fact.
- **`display_name` is a GUID**, not a human name — and it is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
  `_require_display_name()` builds the URL path for sleep, resting HR, daily summary, heart
  rates and personal records. The read surface depends on it. (Value not recorded here; the
  repo is public.)

And one thing nobody had asked:

- **Garmin 429s this IP on the mobile *credential* login paths**, both `mobile+cffi` and
  `mobile+requests`, on the very first attempt. A later strategy succeeded. The **token
  load and refresh path is not throttled** — proven by the serve-time call returning
  cleanly. So §6's rate-limit concern lands on bootstrap, not on serving.

### Two containers, not one

`docker ps` during a live session shows **two** containers for one configured stdio server,
stable across queries (not accumulating). `source/client.py` claimed "under stdio is exactly
one client session." That comment was wrong and is now corrected. It matters because
garminconnect re-dumps tokens whenever it refreshes them, so the token file has two
independent writers with only an in-process lock between them.

### The stress test (10 dimensions, per sop/stress-test-10-dimensions.md)

Run against real library source before building pass 2. Full findings live in
`docs/SCOPE.md` v1.3. The ones that changed the code:

**A data-path 429 does not raise `GarminConnectTooManyRequestsError`.** That type is raised
only by the login strategies. `client._run_request` maps every status >= 400 except 404 onto
`GarminConnectConnectionError` — there is no 429 branch. So a throttled *read* reached our
`_translate` dressed as a connectivity error, and the agent would read it as transient and
retry: exactly what §6 forbids, against an IP already being throttled. **Fixed**, with tests
covering both directions so the check is shown to be able to say no.

**`get_activities_by_date` auto-paginates up to `MAX_PAGINATED_REQUESTS = 2000`** with no
delay between pages. §5's hard result cap lives in our layer, which is too late — the library
has already fired the requests. Recorded so pass 2 builds on `get_activities(start, limit)`
instead.

**§6's rate limiter and short-TTL cache do not exist.** Zero hits across `garmin_mcp/`. Pass 1
did not need them; pass 2 is the first multi-call surface, so they come first.

### pip-audit found something better than a CVE

§8 has always mandated `pip-audit` in CI and it was never wired up. Adding it flagged
`pytest 8.4.2`. Chasing that surfaced the real problem: **`requirements.lock` carried
`pytest`, `pluggy`, `iniconfig`, `Pygments` and `packaging`**, and the Dockerfile does
`pip install -r requirements.lock` — so the production image shipped the test runner and its
whole dependency tree.

The lock is now runtime-only: 40 pins down to 35. Verified by installing the new lock into a
clean venv and importing every module, so nothing load-bearing was cut. `pip-audit` on the
result reports no known vulnerabilities, and a test now fails if dev packages return.

The pytest CVE itself remains in the dev environment. `pyproject.toml` pins `pytest>=8,<9`
and the fix is 9.0.3, so clearing it means widening that ceiling — left as a deliberate
decision rather than a silent bump.

### Also this pass

- `garmin_auth_status` now reports `server_version`, stamped by CI with the commit.
  `docker run` never re-pulls a moving tag, so a config pinned to `latest` runs whatever was
  pulled last with nothing saying so. This makes "am I on the current build?" answerable from
  inside a conversation.
- `_configure_logging` now passes `force=True`. Without it `basicConfig` is a **no-op** when
  the root logger already has handlers, so an earlier import configuring logging at DEBUG
  would have stood — and garminconnect logs full response bodies at DEBUG, which on a health
  endpoint is health data (§8). The level was the only thing preventing that; it now has a
  regression test.

Tests: 10 → 26.

### Client wiring, which cost an hour

Claude Desktop on Windows is the **MSIX/Store build**. Its config is not at `%APPDATA%\Claude`
— it is under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_<pkgid>\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\`, and the
folder only exists after first launch. A packaged app also does not reliably inherit `PATH`,
so `"command": "docker"` is unsafe; use the absolute path to `docker.exe`. Both are now in
§7.

### Open items

- Two containers per session — understood, not yet mitigated. Cross-process token-refresh
  lock is Phase 2.
- Pass 2 phases 2–5 (rate limiter, cache, capability probe, web UI, first read tools) are
  planned and unstarted.
- The `vcrpy` cassette coverage §8 claims still does not exist.

---

## 2026-08-30 (phase 2) — Rate limiter and cross-process lock. Cache deferred.

Phase 1 was verified end to end on the laptop first: the old image reports `pytest in image:
True`, the new one `False`; `server_version` reads `0.2.0+12e6960…`; a live authenticated call
against the new image returns the account name. Both halves of the pytest check were run,
because a single `False` would have been equally consistent with a broken probe.

### What phase 2 built

**`source/ratelimit.py` — a token bucket whose state lives in a file, not in memory.**
This is the direct consequence of the two-container finding. An in-process bucket is enforced
once per process, and there are two processes sharing one token volume, so the real rate
against Garmin would be exactly double the configured one. A limiter that permits twice what
it claims is worse than no limiter, because it invites trust it has not earned. State sits on
the shared volume so both containers draw from one allowance.

Default is one request every two seconds with a burst of four, overridable by
`GARMIN_RATE_PER_SEC` / `GARMIN_RATE_BURST`. The number still has **no empirical basis** and
the module says so in its own docstring.

**`source/lock.py` — a cross-process `flock`.** garminconnect refreshes tokens inline at the
top of every data request and dumps the result to disk, guarded by a `threading.Lock` that
means nothing between containers.

Two details that were easy to get wrong, and would have produced a lock that looked fine:

- **The lock must not be on the token file.** `dump()` writes a temp file and `replace()`s it,
  so the token file gets a new inode on every refresh. `flock` binds to the open file
  description, not the path — a lock held there would, after the first refresh, be held on an
  unlinked inode and exclude nobody. Separate `.garmin.lock`, never replaced.
- **It must be re-entrant within a process.** `flock` is per open file description, so a
  second acquire in the same process blocks against the first. Depth-counted instead.

Both are reached through one doorway, `_garmin_access()` in `client.py`: lock first, then
budget. The other order would let a process spend a token and *then* queue on the lock, so
tokens would be spent by waiting rather than by requesting.

### The cache was deferred, deliberately

§6 called for a short-TTL cache in this phase. Its only possible consumer today is
`garmin_auth_status`, and that tool must never be cached — its entire job is proving the
tokens work *right now*, so a cached answer makes it vacuous. Building it now meant inventing
TTLs before a single data endpoint had been seen. It moves to phase 5, alongside its first
real consumer. §6's placement rule is untouched and still binding: the cache lives in
`source/`, and no tool implements its own.

### Testing the claim, not the code

Both modules assert cross-process behaviour, so both are tested with real subprocesses. An
in-process test here would prove nothing — `threading.Lock` would pass it, and
`threading.Lock` is precisely the thing garminconnect already has and which does not help.

The rate-limit test merges the grant timestamps from two child processes and measures the
spacing of the merged sequence, which is the global rate directly, independent of how the two
happened to interleave.

That test was then **shown to fail**: re-run with a separate state directory per process —
simulating the in-memory bucket — six requests completed in 0.21s against a required 0.35s,
and both assertions failed. A passing test is not evidence until it has been seen to
discriminate.

Also added: an autouse fixture pinning a very high rate for every test that is not about the
rate. The shipped default is one request per two seconds, and a suite that is slow for a
reason nobody remembers is a suite somebody weakens later.

Tests: 26 → 39.

### Open items

- Cache: phase 5.
- Capability probe: phase 3, unstarted. Still the precondition for fixing the tool surface.
- The two-writer risk remains **structural, not observed** — tokens have not needed a refresh
  yet, so the concurrent path has never actually run. The lock is insurance bought before the
  fire.
- `pytest>=8,<9` still blocks the 9.0.3 that clears the dev-side CVE.
