Chronological log of real work on garmin-mcp. Newest entry last.

---

## 2026-08-30 — Pass 1 built, published, and merged. Blocked on Docker Desktop.

### What shipped

**Pass 1 walking skeleton** (PR #1, `43b7f17`) — the whole chain end to end with the
smallest possible surface: bootstrap CLI → token volume → container → stdio → MCP
handshake → one tool → a real authenticated Garmin call.

- One tool, `garmin_auth_status`: read-only, no arguments, so this pass carries none of
  the §5 response-contract decisions (units, timezone basis, result caps).
- 10 tests from a baseline of 0.
- `garmin_mcp/source/` is the only package importing `garminconnect` (SCOPE §11).

**CI + GHCR publishing** (PR #2, `683bea0`) — tests gate the image publish; multi-arch
`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`; pull requests build but cannot push, because the registry
login step is skipped for `pull_request` events.

`main` is at `df7323b`. Image is public at `ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest` —
verified pullable anonymously (anonymous ghcr.io token + manifest fetch returned 200, both
architectures present).

### Two things the library disagreed with the plan about

**A missing token file does not raise `FileNotFoundError`.** `garminconnect.login()`
swallows the load failure in a broad `except Exception`, sets `tokens_loaded = False`, and
then raises `GarminConnectAuthenticationError("Username and password are required")` — the
same exception a genuinely rejected token raises. Without an explicit file-existence check
before `login()`, "never bootstrapped" and "token expired" are indistinguishable and the
operator gets told to re-authenticate when they never authenticated. Fixed, with a test
pinning the distinction.

**`FastMCP` was removed in mcp 2.x.** The entry class is `MCPServer` from `mcp.server`;
the old import path is a shim that raises `ModuleNotFoundError`. This also means every
public Garmin MCP server on GitHub is v1-era and broken against the current SDK, which
independently confirms the decision to build rather than adopt.

Also verified rather than assumed: `get_full_name()` and `get_unit_system()` are cached
attribute reads that make no HTTP call. A smoke test asserting on them alone would be
vacuous — the proof that tokens work is that `login()` completed, since it ends in a real
authenticated profile fetch on every path including cached-token reuse.

### Where we stopped

**Blocked getting Docker Desktop running on the Windows laptop.** Sequence so far:

1. `docker version` printed a `Client:` section with no `Server:` — engine not running.
2. Docker Desktop refused to start: "Virtualization support not detected".
3. Task Manager reported CPU virtualization *Enabled* — that flag is not what Docker means.
   It needs the Windows features.
4. `wsl --status` → WSL not installed.
5. `wsl --install --no-distribution` succeeded, installing WSL 2.7.12 and enabling
   `VirtualMachinePlatform`, twice printing "changes will not be effective until the system
   is rebooted".
6. **Reboot pending.** That is the resume point.

### Resume here after the reboot

```powershell
docker version                      # expect a Server: section, not just Client:
docker pull ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest
docker run -it --rm -v garmin-tokens:/data ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest login
docker run --rm -v garmin-tokens:/data -v "${PWD}:/backup" alpine cp /data/garmin_tokens.json /backup/
```

Choose **WSL2** when Docker Desktop asks for a backend. Leave the `*.docker.internal`
/etc/hosts option unticked — this server never touches the host network.

Back up the token volume immediately after a successful bootstrap. If a captcha ever blocks
a fresh login there is no workaround by design, and that file is the only way back.

Then add to `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` and fully quit/reopen Claude
Desktop (tray icon, not just the window):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "garmin": { "command": "docker",
  "args": ["run","-i","--rm","-v","garmin-tokens:/data",
           "ghcr.io/navyasree-anumula/garmin-mcp:latest","serve"] } } }
```

Success looks like `garmin_auth_status` returning a real display name and unit system.

### If Docker still fails after the reboot

Then the hypervisor is blocked above the firmware — Credential Guard or corporate policy —
and it is an IT ticket, not a configuration problem. **The fallback is to run natively with
Python, no Docker at all.** Verified against PyPI: `curl_cffi` ships `cp310-abi3-win_amd64`
wheels, `garminconnect` and `mcp` are pure Python, `pydantic-core` has `win_amd64` wheels.
Nothing compiles and nothing needs Linux.

That route needs one contained change first, currently **not done**:

- `DEFAULT_TOKENSTORE` is hardcoded to `/data/garmin_tokens.json`, a container path that is
  meaningless on Windows. It needs a platform-aware fallback (e.g.
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\garmin-mcp\garmin_tokens.json`) while keeping `/data` in the container.
- `BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND` in `source/errors.py` tells the operator to run a `docker run`
  command. On a machine that cannot run Docker that is actively wrong advice.
- Tests for both shapes, so the container path cannot silently break.

### Open items

- `docs/SCOPE.md` cites protocol revision 2026-07-28, but `mcp` 2.1.1 negotiates
  `2025-11-25` in the handshake. Harmless, uncorrected.
- A `garmin-mcp:0.1.0` image built on the staging box to verify the Dockerfile is still
  there (315MB), now redundant since CI builds the image.
- Pass 2 is unstarted: the FR570 capability probe, then the first real data tools. That is
  where the units, timezone and result-cap contracts get designed rather than guessed.
